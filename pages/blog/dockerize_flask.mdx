# Introduction

Docker allows you and other users to run your applications with simple commands and little to no setup (outside of the initial docker install).

This tutorial is neither an introduction to flask or docker but rather a look into how you can use these technologies to better develop web applications.

## Downloads

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Setup

Lets start by creating a

```python
import flask

if __name__ === "__main__":
    print("test")
```
