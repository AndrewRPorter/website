# My thoughts on remote work

I've been working remotely as a software engineer at "big" tech companies since I graduated college in 2020 (~3 years). My only experience with traditional office environments was through internships in college and the handful of times I was strongly encouraged to join my team as part of a return to office initiative.

I wanted to share my thoughts on remote work as a way to reflect on the past ~3 years of my career and allow others to point out potential biases.

## Thoughts

The below topics are my thoughts and opinions on remote work in no particular order.

---

### No more commute

My previous commute to work was ~30 minutes each way. This saves me about 5 hours a week or 260 hours a year! I have since re-invested this time into fitness.

### Home kitchen at my disposal

This has been great for my fitness goals but I often find it a distraction as I tend to do dishes, clean, etc. during the work day.

### Can sometimes get lonely with no insight into when / how often my peers are working

I often wonder if I am working too much or too little. In an office environment you can look around and physically see who is working and who is not. This is harder in a remote environment.

### Harder to make friends at work

This might just be a me problem. It seems harder to form true bonds in a remote environment. But, at the end of the day, some people are just at work to work and NOT to make friends.

### Timezones can be a pain in the ass

I don't think this is unique to remote work but I think remote first companies are particularly plagued with timezone scheduling conflicts. This is where asynchronous communication and scheduled message sends can help!

### Autonomy over my schedule

This might not be the case for every remote position but my company is remote first and with this, we are empowered to work when we are able to work best. I am mostly a fan of the traditional 8-5 schedule but some days I work out in the middle of the day or take my dog on a longer than normal walk. This seems like it would be harder to do in an office.

### Meetings can be awkward at times

Everyone is muted for long periods of times at the beginning of meetings. You'll here the typical, "how was your weekend" or suggestions to listen to music for ~5 minutes at the start of the meeting.

Don't get me started on ice breakers. You can only do so many ice breakers people...
