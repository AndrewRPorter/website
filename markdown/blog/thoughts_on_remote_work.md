# My thoughts on remote work

I've been working remotely as a software engineer at "big" tech companies since I graduated college in 2020 (~3 years). My only experience with traditional office environments was through internships in college and the handful of times I was strongly encouraged to join my team as part of a return to office initiative.

I wanted to share my thoughts on remote work as a way to reflect on the past ~3 years of my career and allow others to point out potential biases.

## Thoughts

Below is a list of my thoughts and opinions on remote work in no particular order.

---

### No more commute

My previous commute to work was ~30 minutes each way. This saves me about 5 hours a week or 260 hours a year! I now have more time in my day to do things like work out, cook a big dinner or just sit down and relax.

### Kitchen at my disposal

This has been great for my fitness goals but I often find it a distraction as I tend to do dishes, clean, etc. during the work day.

### Can sometimes get lonely with no insight into when / how often my peers are working

I often wonder if I am working too much or too little. In an office environment you can look around and physically see who is working and who is not. This is harder in a remote environment.

### Harder to make friends at work

This might just be a me problem. It seems harder to form true bonds in a remote environment. But, at the end of the day, some people are just at work to work and NOT to make friends. I find that pairing with teammates on issues or just hosting office hours is a great way to meet people at work.

### Timezones can be a pain in the ass

I don't think this is unique to remote work but I think remote first companies are particularly plagued with timezone scheduling conflicts. This is where asynchronous communication and scheduled message sends can help!

### Autonomy over my schedule

This might not be the case for every remote position but my company is remote first and with this, we are empowered to work when we are able to work best. I am mostly a fan of the traditional 8-5 schedule but some days I work out in the middle of the day or take my dog on a longer than normal walk. This seems like it would be harder to do in an office.

### Meetings can be awkward at times

Everyone is muted for long periods of times at the beginning of meetings. You'll hear the typical, "How was your weekend?" or suggestions to listen to music for ~5 minutes at the start of the meeting.

It can also be hard to actually end meetings. Who says "bye" first? Do I need to stick around after the fact? Is now a good time to go? At my previous company, we solved this by all clapping at the end of a meeting and racing to leave the call.

### Hard to separate home and work

I sometimes find it hard to separate my home environment from my work environment. I've since dealt with this by setting hard stops and periods where I will not work. These are mainly lunch, weekends and after my 8 hours are done for the day. Just because I work from home does not mean I need to make my home my place of work.

### Very little "whiteboarding"

[Whiteboarding](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Whiteboarding) is typically a way to pair on solving a problem with peers. This is something I did a lot of in college but have hardly done any in the "real world". Is this just a culture issue at my company or do people not find this useful anymore. I imagine this would feel a lot more natural in an office with a physical whiteboard. Instead, we are forced to use over-engineered tools like Jamboard or Figma.
