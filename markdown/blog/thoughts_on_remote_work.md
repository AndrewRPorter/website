# My thoughts on remote work

I've been working remotely as a software engineer at "big" tech companies since I graduated college in 2020 (~3 years). My only experience with traditional office environments was through internships in college and the handful of times I was strongly encouraged to join my team in the office as part of a return to office initiative.

I wanted to share my thoughts on remote work as a way to reflect on the past ~3 years of my career and allow others to point out potential biases or things that I missed.

## Thoughts

Below is a bulleted list of pros/cons/thoughts on remote work in no particular order:

- No more commute
   - My previous commute to work was ~30 minutes each way. This saves me about 5 hours a week or 260 hours a year!
- Home kitchen at my disposal
   - As someone who has been lifting recently and attempting to bulk, this is a game changer.
- Can sometimes get lonely with no insight into when / how often my co workers are working
   - temp
- Harder to make friends at work
   - temp (but at the end of the day, some people are just at work to work and NOT to make friends.)
- Timezones can be a pain in the ass
   - I don't think this is unique to remote work but I think remote first companies are particularly plagued with timezone scheduling conflicts. This is where asynchronous communication and scheduled message sends can help!
- Autonomy over my schedule
   - This might not be the case for every remote position but my company is remote first and with this, we are empowered to work when we are able to work best. I am mostly a fan of the traditional 8-5 schedule but some days I work out in the middle of the day or take my dog on a longer than normal walk. This seems like it would be harder to do in an office.
- Meetings can be awkward at times
- temp

I plan to come back and reflect on these thoughts over the course of my career. Stay tuned...
