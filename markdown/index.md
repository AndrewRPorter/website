# Hi, my name is Andrew Porter

I am a remote Software Engineer at GitHub on the billing team. I enjoy writing web applications with Python and Next.js. I consider myself a lifetime learner and am currently diving into the world of Ruby.

Besides writing code, I like to workout, snowboard, golf, and cook.
